## Internet Flicks
[Live Demo](https://internet-flicks.herokuapp.com/#/)

This movie viewing app drew inspiration from Netflix with a cult classics twist. This application was made using Rails/PostgreSQL for the backend and React.js and Redux for the frontend.

## Features
  * Let users sign up for an account, login, and extra demo login
  * Keep user information safe by authentifying users using BCrypt
  * Videos are sorted into different genre containers listed horizantally
  * Clicking on the thumbnail of the movie opens a popout that shows more information about the movie
  * Clicking on the play now button leads to a movie show page

## Technologies

The backend is designed to make API requests, process data, and respond back with the data requested by our front end. RESTful routes were used to keep a clean structure to follow.

The frontend uses React with Redux framework to dynamically display content.
